Helpful Things

Welcome! 
This repository is a collection of miscellaneous items, scripts, and configurations that I've found useful for managing and enhancing my own system. 
I'll be adding new tools and updating their use cases periodically.
  
**AutoHotKey**
  AutoHotKey (AHK) is a powerful, free, and open-source scripting language for Windows that allows you to automate almost anything. You can create scripts to perform complex tasks, remap keys, create custom shortcuts, and much more.
    
    Audio_Switch_NirCMD.ahk
    Switching audio output devices in Windows can sometimes be cumbersome, especially when in a full-screen application or dealing with frequently connected/disconnected USB audio devices. This script simplifies the process.

      Use Case:
        This script allows you to seamlessly toggle between two predefined audio output devices with a single hotkey. 
        This is particularly handy if you regularly switch between headphones and speakers, or if you have a USB audio interface that you don't want to physically unplug to change outputs. 
        It avoids the multiple clicks typically required by the standard Windows audio switching method.
